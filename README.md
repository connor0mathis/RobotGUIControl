CS-330 Robot GUI and Control 

This Repository hosts the project for the CS-330 class project involving making a GUI interface for the iCreate Robot.
The list of requirements we were tasked to complete are as follows:
0. Create a detailed sketch/design of your future UI. Later you will need to implement that look in code. Submit the scan/photo of your sketch as well.
1. Create a GUI to control your robot with at least four buttons.
2. The GUI should have an image at the center which would be changing depending on the motion direction of the robot (here is a screenshot). This image should be in at least 8 possible positions (pointing north, south, west, east, north-west, north-east, south-west, south-east, etc.).
3. The direction should be changing depending on the button pressed as well as keys pressed on the keyboard - w, s, a, d or arrows.
4. The GUI needs to have a "play a tune" button: your tune from the previous lab should be played when one presses it
5. The GUI needs to have a four-symbol input field. If you type any four-digit number, that number should be displayed on the Digit LEDs.
6. The GUI needs to have a four buttons without any text but with colors (red, orange, green, yellow). When any of the buttons is pressed, the Clean/Power LED should have corresponding color.
7. You can optionally add a booster speed button, stop button or any other buttons you would like to have.
Any of the buttons should be able to work at the same time, e.g. if the robot is driving and a user presses "play a tune button", the tune should be played without any interruption of the robot's motion.
